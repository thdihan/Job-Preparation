-   If we use setTimeout and setImmediate, which one come first and why?\
    Even though setTimeout(fn, 0) and setImmediate() both schedule callbacks for future execution, they run in different phases of the event loop: setTimeout(fn, 0) is placed in the Timer phase of the event loop.setImmediate() is placed in the Check phase, which comes after the Poll phase (where I/O callbacks are executed).If there are no I/O operations, the Timers phase executes first (so setTimeout(0) runs before setImmediate()). However, if an I/O operation occurs, the event loop skips the Timer phase and moves directly to the Poll phase, then executes the Check phase (setImmediate()) before the next Timer phase.
